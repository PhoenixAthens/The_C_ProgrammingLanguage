//NOTE about calculating GCD:
/*The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers is the
 * largest positive integer that divides both numbers without
 * a remainder. In other words, itâ€™s the largest number that both
 * numbers can be divided by evenly.
 * In the case of 14 and -21, we can list their divisors to find their GCD:
 * The divisors of 14 are: 1, 2, 7, and 14.
 * The divisors of -21 are: -1, -3, -7, and -21.
 * The largest positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder is 7.
 * Therefore, the GCD of 14 and -21 is 7.
 * Itâ€™s important to note that when calculating the GCD of two numbers,
 * we only consider their absolute values (ignoring their signs). So in this case,
 * we calculate the GCD of 14 and 21 (ignoring the negative sign), which is also 7.
